Experiments in NLP, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence

<b> Autoencoder for Audio </b> is a model where I compressed an audio file and used Autoencoder to reconstruct the audio file, for use in phoneme classification.

<b> Lasagne Neural Nets Regression </b> is a Neural Network model based in Theano and Lasagne, that makes a linear regression with a continuous target variable and reaches 99.4% accuracy. It uses the DadosTeseLogit.csv sample file.

<b> Lasagne Neural Nets + Weights </b> is a Neural Network model based in Theano and Lasagne, where is possible to visualize weights between X1 and X2 to hidden layer. Can also be adapted to visualize weights between hidden layer and output. It uses the DadosTeseLogit.csv sample file.

<b> Multinomial Regression </b> is a regression model where target variable has 3 classes.

<b> Neural Networks for Regression </b> shows multiple solutions for a regression problem, solved with sklearn, Keras, Theano and Lasagne. It uses the Boston dataset sample file from sklearn and reaches more than 98% accuracy.

<b> NLP + Naive Bayes Classifier </b> is a model where movie reviews were labeled as positive and negative and the algorithm then classifies a totally new set of reviews using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes, reaching an accuracy of 92%.

<b> NLP Semantic Doc2Vec + Neural Network </b> is a model where positive and negative movie reviews were extracted and semantically classified with NLTK and BeautifulSoup, then labeled as positive or negative. Text was then used as an input for the Neural Network model training. After training, new sentences are entered in the Keras Neural Network model and then classified. It uses the zip file.

<b> NLP Sentiment Positive </b> is a model that identifies website content as positive, neutral or negative using BeautifulSoup and NLTK libraries, plotting the results.
