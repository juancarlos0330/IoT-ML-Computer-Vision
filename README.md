<b> NLP Semantic Doc2Vec + Neural Network </b> is a model where positive and negative movie reviews were extracted and semantically classified with NLTK and BeautifulSoup, then labeled as positive or negative. Text was then used as an input for the Neural Network model training. After training, new sentences are entered in the Keras Neural Network model and then classified.
